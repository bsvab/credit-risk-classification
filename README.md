# Module 20 Challenge

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Background / Scenario</p> 

Various techniques will be used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company will be used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Credit Risk Analysis Report</p> 

### <p style="color:gray">OVERVIEW</p> 
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the performance of a machine learning model in predicting credit risk for the purposes of securing a loan. The goal is to identify if the model can accurately classify loans, thereby helping a peer-to-peer leanding services company make informed lending decisions and minimize potential losses due to defaults.

### <p style="color:gray">RESULTS</p> 
- <ins>Accuracy Score</ins>: 
    - For the logistic regression model, the accuracy is 0.99, indicating that it correctly predicts 99% of the loan classifications.
- <ins>Precision Score</ins>:
    - For healthy loans (0), the precision is 1.00. When the model predicts a loan as healthy, it is correct 100% of the time.
    - For high-risk loans (1), the precision is 0.85. This indicates that the model is correct approximately 85% of the time.
- <ins>Recall Score</ins>: 
    - For healthy loans (0), the recall is 0.99. This indicates that the model correctly identifies 99% of the healthy loans. 
    - For high-risk loans (1), the recall is 0.91. This means that the model captures approximately 91% of the actual high-risk loans.
<br>

### <p style="color:gray">SUMMARY</p> 

The logistic regression model performs extremely well in predicting healthy loans (0), with high precision and recall scores. For high-risk loans (1), the model still performs reasonably well, with slightly lower precision but high recall, indicating that while it may misclassify some healthy loans as high-risk, it effectively captures a large portion of actual high-risk loans.

Based on the results, I would recommend using the logistic regression model for credit risk analysis. Its high precision ensures accurate identification of high-risk loans, reducing the likelihood of approving risky borrowers. Additionally, its high recall ensures that a significant portion of actual high-risk loans is captured, minimizing potential losses due to defaults.

However, while the logistic regression model performs well overall, it may still misclassify some loans. It remains important to supplement model predictions with human judgment and additional risk assessment techniques to make well-informed decisions.
